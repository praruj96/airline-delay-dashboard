# US Flight Delay Visualization

This project presents an interactive data visualization analysis of  US domestic flights from 2015. Using Tableau and R, we analyzed flight delays, cancellations, airline performance, and the busiest routes and airports across the country.

Visualizations & Dashboards
- Waffle Charts: On-time vs. delayed flight percentage by airline (R + ggplot2 + waffle).
- Airports Dashboard: Average air time, elapsed time, delay types, and airline distribution.
- Delay Dashboard: Routes, causes, average delay by airline and month.
- Cancellation Mosaics: Percent and reasons for flight cancellations across airlines.
- Weather Delay Panel: Seasonal and regional weather-related delays.
- Busiest Routes & Airlines: Flight volumes and operational hubs.


## Tools Used
- Tableau
- R (ggplot2, waffle, dplyr)
- Excel
- Dataset -  2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/data?select=flights.csv)

## Key Insights
- Delta and Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time performance.
- Weather delays spiked in winter across Midwest & Northeast.
- Busiest US route: SFO to LAX; busiest airline: Southwest.
- Spirit Airlines had the highest delay percentage (~28%).
